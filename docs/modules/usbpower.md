This module provides 3 standard USB connections for powering external equipment. Take care not to draw more power than your AE Modular power supply offers. Check the milliampere (mA) value on the power supply and your attached devices.

!!! Inputs

None.

!!! Outputs

* 3 x '''USB''' connections - power supply only.
* 4 x '''+5V''' - +5 volt output
* 4 x '''Ground''' -  earth for completing circuit for DIY modules etc.in conjunction with +5 volt output.

!!! Controls

None.

!!! Patch Suggestions

The +5 volt out can be used as a modulation source, although other modules provide a constant voltage as well. Use a [[4ATTMIX]] or [[2ATTCV]] to attenuate as needed.

This module comes with a USB light so mount the module so it shines down over your patching/playing area, or at least not into your eyes....
