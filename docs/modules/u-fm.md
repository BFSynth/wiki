This micro module is a two operator FM oscillator with either sinewaves or 4 other waveform combinatios which can produce a wide range of sounds. It can be controlled via CV or via MIDI when combined with IMDI HEART or Wonkystuff's mb/1 MIDI source modules.

Module power consumption: ? mA

## Inputs
* **CV** - controls the pitch of the oscillator
* **IMDI** - MIDI signals to control the various parameters of the FM operators as well as pitch
* **MD** - ?
* **MLT** - ?

## Outputs
* **OUT** - the sound of the oscillator
* **SO** - a squarewave sub oscillator which is pitched one octave lower than the main oscillator
* **MX** - both main sound and sub oscillator mixed together

## Controls
* **FREQ** (knob) - Controls and offsets the frequency of the oscillator
* **OCT 0/+2** (switch) - allows to add 2 octaves to the main pitch
* **MOD DPT MODE** - ?
