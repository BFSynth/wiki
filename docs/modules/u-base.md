This module makes no sound; its function is being a holder for micro modules, (denoted by a µ before their name on the Wiki), and connecting them to the bus for power etc.

There are 2 sizes of micro module - 1/2 and 1/3. As you may expect, 2 1/2 modules  will fit on a µBASE, or 3 1/3 size modules. You can do a 1/2 and a 1/3 module together if necessary. 

Module power consumption: none


## Patch Suggestions

Fill this module with any combination of 1/3 or 1/2 micro modules as you like!
