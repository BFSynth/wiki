The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is a typical analog audio oscillator with 1V/Oct pitch tracking for musical purposes. VCOs are one of the most basic audio sources in a synthesizer. Their sound is usually further shaped and refined by filters, wavefolders, voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) and other audio effects.

Module power consumption: 16 mA

!!! Inputs
* '''CV1''' - control voltage input for pitch frequency (1V/Oct)
* '''CV2''' - another control voltage input for pitch frequency (1V/Oct)
* '''MOD''' - control voltage input for modulating either frequency or the square wave's pulse width
* '''PW''' - dedicated pulse width modulation control voltage input
* '''SYNC''' - resets the waveform when a trigger signal is received

!!! Outputs
* 2x '''RAMP''' - ramp/sawtooth wave output
* 2x '''TRI''' - triangle wave output, quieter than the other outputs so it might need amplification via the [[2signalamp.md | 2SIGNALAMP]] module for example
* 2x '''SQUARE''' - square wave output
* '''BUS CV''' - pitch control voltage form the [[master.md| MASTER I/O]] module's MIDI-CV converter 

!!! Controls
* '''MOD DEPTH''' Potentiometer - attenuator for the MOD input control voltage
* '''MOD DEPTH''' Switch - switches the MOD control voltage target between frequency and pulse width
* '''COARSE''' - coarse tuning of the VCO frequency
* '''FINE''' - fine tuning of the VCO frequency
* '''PULSEWIDTH''' - manual control over the square wave's pulse width, control voltage modulation is added to this potentiometer setting
