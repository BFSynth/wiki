The DRUMKIT 010 consists of 11 8-bit drum sound samples; 6 of them can be triggered in parallel in any combination by the trigger inputs.Don't expect high quality from this module - it's by design a nasty, lo-fi drum sound source, but definitely with its own character. Works great together with the [[ kick.md | analog KICK module ]].

Module power consumption: 3 mA

## Inputs
* **BD** - trigger for bass drum
* **SD** - trigger for snare drum
* **CP** - trigger for clap
* **CH** - trigger for closed hi-hat
* **OH** - trigger for open hi-hat
* **FX** - trigger for FX sound
* **PITCH CV** - cv control of pitch for all sounds
* **ACCENT** - trigger for accent

## Outputs
* **OUT** - audio output of mix of all sounds
* **MULT** - unbuffered multiple

## Controls
* **BANK** Knob - select a bank of sounds, this selects different sounds for the 6 channels. Because there are only 11 sounds in total, each bank is a different mix of 6 of those sounds.
* **PITCH** Knob - select the pitch of all sound samples
* **REVERSE** Button - while pressed, all samples will play in reverse
* **TRIG MODE** Switch - if set to A any rising signal will trigger, if set to D a short pulse is expected.

## Patch Suggestions

The DRUMKIT works best when triggered by either the [[topograf.md | TOPOGRAF]], [[triq164.md | TRIQ 164]] or [[mmdiv.md
 | MM-DIV]] modules. 

Some older versions of this module are a bit low in volume, so patching the output through the [[2signalamp.md|2SIGNALAMP]] will boost the signal to be on par with other voices in the system. 

One of the great things you can do within modular is combine sounds; this module can be used to put an a noise on the attack part of a sustaining sound from a VCO; Roland D50 Sound and Synthesis for 10% of the price! 

The drum sounds from this module can, of course, be processed by the rest of your AE system; [[delay.md| Lo-fi delay]], Filters and [[keurslagerkurt-deadband.md| Kurt's Deadband]] are highly recommended.
