The FADRMIX6 is a performance mixer with FX sends, and stereo out with AE and 3.5mm jack outputs. It comes with 6 channels but will be extendable with channel extension modules (TBD). Each channel has 2 FX levels and a click-free mute button. Left and Right main mix level can be adjusted independently. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack with pre-amp.

Each channel has actually 2 inputs which are summed together at equal level, so the mixer can be used as a 12 channel mixer (of sorts).

This module can be extended with quarter inch output jacks and 3.5mm FX send/return jacks via the [FADRMIX JACKOUT](modules/fadrmix_jackout.md) module.

Module power consumption: ? mA

Module width: 5 units

## Inputs

* **IN 1** - **IN 6** - the signal in for each of the 6 channels. There are two sockets for each input which are summed together into the same channel.

**On the right side, (usually outputs on the AE):**

* **FX Return 1L** - the level of this signal is controlled by the FX1 rtn lvl knob
* **FX Return 1R** - the level of this signal is controlled by the FX1 rtn lvl knob
* **FX Return 2L**- the level of this signal is controlled by the FX2 rtn lvl knob
* **FX Return 2R**- the level of this signal is controlled by the FX2 rtn lvl knob

The return signals for both FX can be switched to MONO (either L or R is copied to the other channel) or Stereo (both channels are merged into the mix) according to the switches next to the FX level knobs.

These could be utilised to input more signals into the mix as well, (not just FX)....

## Outputs

* **Main Out L** - Left channel of the stereo mixed output.
* **Main Out R** - Right channel of the stereo mixed output.
* **FX Send 1** - Mono out controlled by the 6 FX1 send knobs. For patching within AE.
* **FX Send 2** - Mono out controlled by the 6 FX2 send knobs. For patching within AE.

You can also add these modules for more output options:

## Controls

Each channel has 3 knobs, 1 fader and one mute button with the same function, (Channel number is by the level knob):-

* **FX 1 Send** (knob) - controls the amount of signal sent to FX1 send output.
* **FX 2 Send** (knob) - controls the amount of signal sent to FX2 send output.
* **Pan** (knob) - set where in the stereo field that channel is played, from fully Left to fully right.
* **Level** (fader) - controls the amount of signal in the Mix L/R outputs.
* **MUTE** (button) - this click-less button can mute or unmute the channel. The LED above the button is ON when the channel is muted and OFF when the channel is unmuted.

Do bear in mind that the amount of signal sent to the FXs (and their return level) will also affect the apparent loudness of the sound as well as the level control.

* **FX 1 rtn lvl** - controls the amount of signal from the FX 1 return inputs in the Main outputs
* **FX 2 rtn lvl** - controls the amount of signal from the FX 2 return inputs in the Main outputs
* **Main Level** - Sets the volume of the Main outputs

This is the only mixer module in the AE Modular line-up where the left and right main mix output levels can be adjusted individually!

* **MAIN Level L** (fader) - adjust the level of the left main mix output
* **MAIN Level R** (fader) - adjust the level of the right main mix output

## Patch Suggestions

This is one of many mixer modules for the AE Modular system. What makes it more performance oriented is the better feedback you get from the long through faders, the channel mute buttons and the fact that you can control the left and right level of the main mix.
