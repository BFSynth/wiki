This module makes no sound; its function is being a holder for micro modules, (denoted by a µ before their name on the Wiki), and connecting them to the bus for power etc.

This base can hold 4 micro modules and is compatible with the new Quick Swap case. In addition it exposes a few signals from the bus: CV, GATE, CTRL, START, STOP, CLOCK, +5V, GND.

Module power consumption: none

Module width: 2 units

## Patch Suggestions

Fill this module with any combination of micro modules as you like!
