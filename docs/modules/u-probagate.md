!! µPROBAGATE
[[https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p181/uPROBAGATE.html  | View Product Page]]

This 1/3 height  micro module routes an incoming gate signal to one of 3 outputs based on chance via a probability function. This is very similar to the Bernoulli Gate from Mutable Instruments.

This module needs to be installed on the [[AeManual/uBASE | µBASE]] module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

!!! Inputs

* '''GT IN''' - this is the incoming gate signal
* '''PRB CV''' - controls the probability of the signal being routed one way or another

!!! Outputs

* '''OUT 1, 2, 3''' - either one or more will output the incoming gate signal based on the probability function.

!!! Controls

* '''PROBABILITY''' Pot - changes the probability of the gate being routed one way or another.
* '''SINGLE / PAR''' Switch - In single mode, only one output will be triggered at a time. In Parallel mode,  2 or more outputs can be triggered at once, which can be really interesting with pitched sounds on each trigger.

!!! Patch Suggestions

This module is perfect for generative patches where events are driven by chance. For instance it can be used to kick off one of 3 different Envelopes which could introduce variation in sound events.

The gate can also be used as a clock for 3 different sequencers which move forward based on the probability function and create not completely random melodies, but at least random sequences in which the programmed melody is played.
