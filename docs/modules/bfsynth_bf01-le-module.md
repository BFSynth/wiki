* '''Table''' - changes the chords, sometimes the harmonics  of the sound.
* '''Wave''' -  affects the harmonics and/or chords in the sound.

* '''Bus Gate''' - on early modules this is actually the bus CV derived from the midi input on the master module, usually for the pitch.
* '''Bus CV''' - on early modules this is actually the bus CV derived from the midi input on the master module, usually key on/off.
Top Right
* '''Out 1''' - Main output.
* ''' Out 2''' - duplicate output, quite useful for using a different filter &/or FX on. 

* '''Mult''' - a passive splitter/mixer not connected with the module circuitry.
