!! MIXCON JACK OUT

[[ https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p131/MIXCONSOLE_JACKOUT.html | View Product Page]]

This module adds the convenience of plugging 1/4 inch (6.5mm) cables straight into the AE Modular without having to use any adapter cables. It is not a freestanding design, it needs to [[AeManual/MIXCONSOLE|MIXCONSOLE]] to work, and has to be mounted adjacent to that module where it connects via a short cable at the back.

! Patch Suggestions

This module is useful if you want to restrict the number of 3.5mm to 6.35mm cables you need to buy!

More seriously it means regular studio leads can be used  which generally give better audio quality and, probably, more reliable connection. They also come in much longer lengths if needed....

If you are also adding the XLR outputs, ideally this module should be attached first, then the [[AeManual/MIXCONXLROUT|MIXCONXLR]] ...
