# Category: IMDI

IMDI is a form of interpreting MIDI signals which is special to the AE Modular system. First introduced by Wonkystuff with the mb/1 module it allows MIDI signals to be routed between modules via a single patch cabel!

The modules in this category all either produce, transform, listen to or consume MIDI signals which may or may not conform to the IMDI specification.
