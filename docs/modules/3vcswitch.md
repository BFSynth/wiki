This module gives you 3 separate switches, controllable from the buttons on the front panel or via the gate inputs.  Each circuit can be used bidirectionally; i.e a signal can be sent to one of two destinations or one of two signals can be selected to go to the output.

Module power consumption: 4 mA

!!! Inputs

* ''' IO1''' - Circuit 1's in/out going  to/from 1A or 1B
* '''Gate1''' - a +5V pulse here switches from 1A to 1B or from 1B to 1A
* '''IO2''' - Circuit 2's in/out going  to/from 2A or 2B
* '''Gate2'''  - a +5V pulse here switches from 2A to 2B or from 2B to 2A
* '''IO3''' - Circuit 3's in/out going  to/from 3A or 3B
* '''Gate3'''  - a +5V pulse here switches from 3A to 3B or from 3B to 3A
* '''+5V''' - actually an output giving +5V, the maximum the AE Modular can deal with. Very useful for further processing via this module or others for modulation.
* '''Bus Gate''' - This output gives a +5V  signal whilst an external midi device key on is pressed, via the Master module.

!!! Outputs

* '''1A''' - Circuit 1's A in/out
* '''1B''' - Circuit 1's B in/out
* '''2A''' - Circuit 2's A in/out
* '''2B''' - Circuit 2's B in/out
* '''3A''' - Circuit 3's A in/out
* '''3B''' - Circuit 3's B in/out

!!! Controls

The panel is marked 1,2 and 3 for each circuit, the controls are the same for each.

* '''Latch''' button. - When this button is pressed it moves the connection from A to B or B to A.
* '''MMT''' button. - When this button is pressed output/input on A is switched to B, or vice versa, but only whilst the switch is pressed, i.e. it is a momentary button. 

!!! Patch Suggestions

There is a patch challenge for this module on the forum. Here you can find more interesting uses of this module: http://forum.aemodular.com/thread/313/patch-challenge-pulling-old-switcheroo

This module is excellent for providing variation in rhythms/ sequences by cutting a trigger in or out via the buttons if "playing" the AE modular, or the gate inputs - the latter can be done with an LFO, envelope or one of the sequencer modules. It works really well with the [[triq164.md | TRIQ164]] module. The [[seq16.md | SEQ16]] module main out can work with a bit of care, but it works really well using of one of the various gate outputs to the 3VCSwitch, especially combined with the [[logic.md|Logic module]] to vary things further.

It is useful where you want to automate switching between 2 audio paths, (e.g. 2 different filters) as part of a patch. 

It can be used to create Stereo from mono by going 1 in to 2 out, (thanks to [[/artists/the-tuesday-night-machines.md| Tuesday Night Machines]] for this one). He suggests "now use a square VCO to quickly switch that audio signal between the ears for crazy effects". 

Other trigger/ trigger variation modules, like the [[trip.md | Trip]], [[mmdiv.md|MM Divider]] and, particularly the [[topograf.md | Topograf]] combine with the 3VCSwitch for endless possibilities.

This video is for a Eurorack module similar to the 3VCSWITCH, and so gives some more ideas you may want to explore.
