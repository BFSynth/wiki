The uPOLY is a polyphonic, 4-voice sawtooth oscillator module.

It can work either as a source of pre-defined chords in major or minor scale; or it can be controlled via IMDI as a paraphonic oscillator with a common envelope.

Each voice consists of two sawtooth oscillators, that can be detuned by a certain amount; this makes this module most suitable for smooth pad sounds.

A switch changes between minor and major scale; the FREQ knob and the CV input goes through the chords of the chosen scale.

Another feature of the module is a chorus effect that can be mixed into the output.

When controlled by IMDI, the possibilities are even more:
* Notes can be played individually
* A common volume envelope is applied to the sound; Attack and Decay time can be controlled via MIDI controller messages from your DAW or MIDI controller
* An LFO with adjustable rate and depth can be applied
* All parameters can be controlled by MIDI controllers via the IMDI HEART module; over one single patch cable! (Regarding IMDI, see IMDI HEART for more info).

## Inputs
* **CV** - Switches between chords of the chosen scale (major or minor)
* **IMDI** - Input for MIDI signals, these should come from either the [[imdi-heart.md | IMDI HEART]] or the [[wonkystuff_mb1.md | Wonkystuff mb/1 modules]]. Many parameters of this module can only be controlled via MIDI.
* **CHD** - ?
* **CV2** - ?

## Patch Suggestions
Although quite powerful on its own, this module is best paired with and IMDI HEART or mb/1 module to receive MIDI messages.
