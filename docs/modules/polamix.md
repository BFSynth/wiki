!! POLAMIX
[[https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p94/POLAMIX.html | View Product Page]]

The POLAMIX is similar to the [[AeManual/2CVTOOL]] in that you can offset, attenuate and invert signals, but it also acts as a 3 channel mixer. Try to use this with 3 LFOs for modulation mayhem!

Module power consumption: 2 mA

!!! Inputs
* '''IN 1''' - accepts any CV or audio signal
* '''IN 2''' - accepts any CV or audio signal
* '''IN 3''' - accepts any CV or audio signal

!!! Outputs
* '''Bus CV''' - CV signal from MIDI
* '''Bus CTRL''' - CTRL signal from MIDI
* '''OUT''' (x2) - output of the 3 channel mix
* '''MULT''' - passive multiple, not connected to the module's circuitry

!!! Controls
* '''OFFSET''' - Boost or lower the overall level of the output
* '''LEVEL 1''' - Boost or lower the signal level of input 1.
* '''LEVEL 2''' - As above for channel 2.
* '''LEVEL 3''' - As above for channel 3.

!!! Patch Suggestions

This module is excellent for combining CVs, e.g. an [[https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/ADSR| Envelope]] and [[https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2LFO| LFO]] to go to one destination (e.g. Filter cut off frequency); you can set the level of modulation for each of 3 CVs input, and this is very tweakable during a performance. 

It makes an excellent submixer to combine the [[https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2OSCD| oscillator]] outputs for different timbres, this could be the multiple outputs from one VCO or up to 3 separate ones...
