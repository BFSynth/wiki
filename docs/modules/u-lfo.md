!! µLFO
[[https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p180/uLFO.html  | View Product Page]]

This 1/3 height micro module provides a tiny LFO with three different waveforms: triangle, sawtooth and square wave. It also offers CV control for pulsewidth modulation for the square wave and a sync input to synchronise the waves with a a reference signal.

This module needs to be installed on the [[AeManual/uBASE | µBASE]] module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

!!! Inputs

* '''PW CV''' - CV control for pulse width of the square wave
* '''SYNC''' - input another LFO or clock source to synchronise waves

!!! Outputs

* '''OUT''' (top) - outputs either a triangle or sawtooth wave depending on the position of the wave switch
* '''OUT''' (bottom) - always outputs a square wave

!!! Controls

* '''PULSE WIDTH''' Pot - controls the pulse width of the square wave output
* '''RATE''' Pot - controls the frequency of the LFO
* '''Wave''' switch - select the output waves, either triangle or sawtooth.

!!! Patch Suggestions

This can be used like any other LFO, see suggestions at [[AeManual/2LFO]].

The square output is very useful for clocking sequencers, triggering Envelope generators etc.
