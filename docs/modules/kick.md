!! KICK
[[ https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p73/KICK.html | View Product Page]]

Analogue drum machine style kick (bass) drum

Module power consumption: 3 mAÃ¥

!!! Inputs

* '''Trig''' - use a pulse to activate the module sound, usually via  one of the divider modules, or the Topograf module.
* '''Mult''' - a passive signal mixing/splitting capability  on several AE modules, no control of signal levels within the module.
* '''Bus Gate''' - +5V with key on from an external keyboard over midi via the master module.

!!! Outputs

* '''Out''' (3) - signal out.
* '''Mult''' -  passive signal mixing/splitting, no control of signal levels within the module.

!!! Controls

* '''Pitch''' - sets basic pitch of sound
* '''Decay''' - sets how long it takes the sound to stop after triggering.
* '''Drive''' - more drive adds roughness/buzz and volume.
* '''Pitch Decay''' Switch - The Decay can also cause the pitch to drop as well as volume. 1980's Simmons drums... 
* '''Trig''' - direct, manual triggering of module - very useful.

!!! Patch Suggestions

The Kick module doesn't go very low in Pitch for modern tastes, going through one of the filters can fix this - the [[https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/NYLEFILTER|Nyle Filter]] is recommended.

The [[https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/DELAY| Lo Fi delay]] can be fun...
