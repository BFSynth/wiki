# Gavin Forbes

[[img|artists/images/gavinforbes.png|200]]

My name is Gavin Forbes and I do bass led melodic electronic / alternative instrumental music. My big creative interest is the combination of my fretless bass with fx (now the AE as well as pedals) alongside my AE modular. 

I perform this music live in a duo set up  (alongside my dad Andy Forbes on keys) using the AE as our third band member for all the drum and sequenced synth layers. And we are now even doing the live played keys on an AE rack thanks to the new IMDI Tangible Waves Poly oscillator & MCO from Wonkystuff. 

I love what the AE has opened up to me for my music. Itâ€™s been a game changer!
