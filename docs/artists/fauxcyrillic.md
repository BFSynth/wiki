Bedroom guitarist, bedroom synthesist, bedroom synth-builder.

Interested in big sounds and little sounds. Thanks to AE Modular and the community, I've enjoyed learning the basics of electronic design and the pleasure of developing my own modules - I'm delighted that almost 60 modules I've built have found a home in racks across thirteen countries around the globe!

Musically I'm particularly interested in ambient and generative work, but sometimes you just need to turn it up and get loud....
