# Visuelle Musik

[[img|artists/images/visuellemusik.jpg|400]]

"Visuelle Musik" is the current solo-project of Mathias Brüssel from Mainz, Germany. He is active recording and performing with various formations since quite a while, including for "Flow" and "La mansarde hermétique". He is also developing applications for creative purposes, including software for algorithmic composition, for video-animation synced to music or firmware for hardware like MPE controllers. 

More recently he became a writer with a focus on DIY and modular synthesis for a music magazine. AE Modular [[AeManual/GRAINS | GRAINS]] and TBD are his favourite modules, because he can make those (almost) whatever he wants them to be.

He has created numerous firmwares/plugins for the [[AeManual/GRAINS | GRAINS]] and  TBD modules which you can find on Github at https://github.com/aemodular/GRAINS and https://github.com/aemodular/ctag-tbd
