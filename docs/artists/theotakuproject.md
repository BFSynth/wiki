[[img|artists/images/theotakuproject.jpg|400]]

i have been making music since my teens. playing in punk rock and metal bands. i have spent many years experimenting with different instruments but through my love of bands such as boards of canada, four Tet, apex twin etc. eventually came across synthesisers. this has given me a new love for music and A way i can make music on my own. this is the otaku project.
