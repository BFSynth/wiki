# The Soviet Space Dog Project

[[img|artists/images/thesovietspacedogproject.jpg|400]]

I’m Andy Bloyce and I’m from London in the UK. I’ve been dabbling in electronic music since the late 70’s and my real passion is for the style that is often labelled as Berlin School (think Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Manuel Göttsching, etc.). 

I was (and now am now once again) a member of the band Kubusschnitt, and I also produce music via The Soviet Space Dog Project and The Ambient Fish Society… and more, but they’re for people to find by accident when hunting through the obscure backroads of Bandcamp.

If you are so moved, here are a few links where you can find examples of what I do:

I have decades’ worth of various bits of hardware that I don’t use very much, it really is time to sell a few things. What I’ve listed is what I find is currently working well as a small setup that allows me to do anything that I can imagine, especially when combined with the vast array of quality (and free) VSTs for things like the Mellotron, old organs and pianos.

I work as live as possible, recording the stereo feed off my small mixer, either into Reaper (via a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4) or into a Tascam DR-40X. Mixing, and any mastering, takes place in Reaper, using more of those wonderful free VSTs.

My AE Modular is the ambient workhorse in my setup, producing most of the backings and introductions to a lot of my pieces, often cross-patched with the Bastl Kastle.
