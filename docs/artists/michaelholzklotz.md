# Michael Holzklotz

[[img|artists/images/michaelholzklotz.jpg|400]]

The universe is huge and Michael Holzklotz is small...this is the main theme of the most of my songs.
I'm doing Lo-Fi Rock and Popsongs in German language but also electronic and experimental music.

My new ambient project is called "Waldrand" and so far my ae modular system is the heart of this project.
I'm also running a little independent label called "Kaktusgleichapfelbaum-Records". You can find our music on nearly every streaming platform.
