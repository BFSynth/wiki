Hey, I am Glitchyfrog. 

This stands for raw music, no rules and a sound between LookMumNoComputer and Throbbing Gristle.
But please put the genre-expectations away, i produce what feels right. And what chaos gifts me :P
If you're lucky or you are following me on YouTube and Soundcloud, you might see one of my live-streams. There I jam or experiment around.
You can download my music on Bandcamp, doe I am not uploading there frequently. Please feel free and ask me directly on social media.
Stay as you are!
