Hi, I'm Mathias. 
I started making music to try out a few ideas about generative processes and fell in love with modular systems, and generative music as a whole, right there. 
I enjoy patching slowly evolving soundscapes and let them drift in the background while I do something else, endlessly tweaking and adjusting wherever a patch take me to.
