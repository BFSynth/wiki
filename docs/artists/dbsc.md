I'm a noisemaker, audio engineer and general doer of interesting things from Melbourne, Australia. 
I got ahold of an AE system in early 2019 and have slowly been building my way up to a system and studio setup I can use to work primarily out of the box and make some girthy, wall-of-sound synth-filled music.
I'm a confirmed lurker on the forum, you can find me under the username @bradaddle.

!! Studio

I'm happily working with my AE modular, two modded MS-20 Mini's and an Alesis Midiverb run through a modded Yamaha MC1202 desk into Ableton, which I also use as my primary sequencer.
