# The Tuesday Night Machines

[[img|artists/images/thetuesdaynightmachines.jpg|400]]

I discovered my passion for electronic music in 2010 and it has been a major part of my life ever since. Starting out with Software and MIDI controllers transitioned to entirely DAWless music setups quickly and the pursuit of knowledge around hardware-based workflows, instrument design concepts and synthesizer DIY led me deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. Electronic music is a journey for me, which I document in hundreds of videos on my YouTube channel, roughly half of which are personal music diary entries in the form of jam sessions. I thoroughly enjoy being active in the community of musicians and instrument creators and I love the human touch we bring to our machines.
