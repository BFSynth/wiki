I have my AE Modular since begin of 2024. It is my first modular synthesiser. It is totally different to make sounds with it, compared with instruments like guitar, keyboard or drums. I also use Studio One DAW with a lot of plug-ins to create music, but the haptic of a computer and the haptic of a modular synthesiser are two different worlds. 

Since I find AE Modular at the internet I am on fire. There are a lot of new ideas for new modules and functions, but it needs a long time to come from the idea to a new module at the rack. Currently my focus is more at my DIY modules than on making music.

I have programmed a lot of different music on my computer. Currently I haven’t published it. Maybe I will do it in future.

## Gear in my Studio

* Starter Rack 2 
* AKAI MINIAK synthesiser connected with the AE by Midi
* Windows PC with “Presonous Firestudio Project” audio interface

In my room a have a lot of addition equipment like drum-set, Roland RD700 stage piano, Technics AX7 keyboard, Casio CZ-101 synth, some guitars and bass guitars with amps and effects and much more.
