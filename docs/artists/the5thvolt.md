# The 5th Volt

[[img|artists/images/the5thvolt.jpg|400]]

I'm an artist from Australia who dabbles in electronic music. I also try to help beginners getting started with the AE Modular system with my series of tutorial videos on my YouTube channel.

I've also started and maintain the [[https://forum.aemodular.com | AE Modular forum]] and you can find me there under my username @admin.
