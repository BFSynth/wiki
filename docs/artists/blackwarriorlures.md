# Black Warrior Lures

[[img|artists/images/blackwarriorlures.jpg|400]]

I'm a fisherman, and I make fishing content on YouTube. These are more than fishing videos. They are true documentary short films. After exhausting much of the music in the YouTube database, I decided to put my music training to work and score my own videos/films using modular synthesizers.

!!Gear
I have upgraded my AE modular synthesizer a MONSTACASE (4 rows of 20U). I don't use external controllers. Every sound is with the AE Modular. I use a TASCAM DR70 to record the audio. It's the same audio recorder used to film my YouTube videos.
 
This year I bought an Avante Achromic AS8 column PA system. Boy, it's sleek, and it sounds great! It's a portable PA system design to make a wide swath of sound without it being painfully loud as most loudspeakers. I call it the Megalith!
 
I compose all the music for my YouTube channel. Cameras are a pair of Z-cam E2C cinema cameras with vintage Canon FD lenses. Ninja V and a Ninja 2 video recorders recording in Apple Prores HQ.
