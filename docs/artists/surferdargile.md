# Surfer d'Argile

Surfer d'Argile is riding some muddy waveforms and shallows  filterings. Inspired by the limestone hills  and the  not so blue sea of its hometown, Surfer d'Argile use several interconnected synths and devices in a very spontaneous way,  in order to make some longer-odds-unperceptibles cycles and periods emerge from the foamy chaos.
