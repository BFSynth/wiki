Mini:profile.jpg

I am a multi-instrumentalist and recovering singer-songwriter from Norway, residing in Denmark.

I started falling down into the modular rabbit hole as a result of the corona-pandemic one and a half year ago, and still falling! 

I like to embrace creative constraints and simplicity, allthough i find that the starter rack 2 which i now operate is far from limited. 

I use the Arturia MicroFreak to control the starter rack, and this helps me interact with the starter rack in a even more tangible way, which i love.
