! Dalarne

I've been dabbling with composing music for more than 40 years but never released anything yet. Now starting to finish parts of my musical ideas and hopefully releasing them soon. I mainly make music that is instrumental, cinematic, melodic and eclectic. Most of it is electronic and not modular, but lately I also started using modular gear and especially the AE Modular system!

!! What's in my Studio

AE Modular and Volca Modular are my current hardware favourites along with the MiniBrute2S.
But I mainly work with software synths using Reason as my DAW.
