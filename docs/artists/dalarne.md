# Dalarne

I've been dabbling with composing music for almost 50 years but my first album was released 2023. Second album was released in 2024. I mainly make music that is instrumental, cinematic, melodic and eclectic. I really don't know what genre my music belongs to. I guess I am too chaotic in my journeys in the sonic landscape... I never know what to expect but sometimes I find some scenic routes that develops into finished tracks.

!! What's in my Studio

AEModular 4x20 rack, Eurorack and some synths like Volcas, MiniBrute2S, Microfreak, Minilogue XD are what I use most of the time when jamming or creating music. As the years go by I seem to enjoy hardware more and more and software synths less. I still use software effects though and use Reason as my DAW.
