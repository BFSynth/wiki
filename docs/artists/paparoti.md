# Papa Rôti

[[img|artists/images/paparoti.png|400]]

Papa Rôti is my solo project. I'm trying to put all my trick gathered during last 20+ years of been a hobbyist musician. I have always been that guy bringing a bass or a guitar into an electro jam or a synth and some drum machine into a jazz jam. In a nutshell, you could expect anything from lofi chill to electronic hardcore in one of my set. I always try to correct or mix as less as possible to have track demonstrating what you'd be earing from me live.
