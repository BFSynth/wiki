# Cross4Eyes

[[img|artists/images/cross4eyes.jpg|400]]

Aspiring emotion alchemist that tries to translate the innermost raw feelings into a bleep or bloop sound. There is little to no self here, nothing but a reflection of you…  inspired by the things that are most difficult to materialize yet critical to our every day lives. The fixations, the overwhelming, the bottomless pit of dealing with this. I live in that realm as a fly on the wall… we are together there…. and we will talk about it.


# Gear
MC707, AE Modular, and a small niftycase eurorack coming soon!
