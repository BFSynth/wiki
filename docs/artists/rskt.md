Hi, I'm RSKT! An artist based on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. I've been making art for as long as I can remember. I've got a real passion for learning and sharing knowledge, so I've been making a lot of tutorials for the AE Modular system lately. I think it's a fantastic modular environment and I'm excited to see what it will grow into in the future!
