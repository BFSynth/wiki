My first exposure to electronic music was from listening to Detroit
radio DJ, The Electrifying Mojo, playing Kraftwerk on a transistor radio
in the late '70s.  I was instantly hooked!  In the early '80s I
witnessed the burgeoning dance music scene in Detroit where high school
groups kept dance music alive after the so-called "death of Disco".  In
the late 80s while in college, I heard all of the first House music
records coming out of Chicago and the legendary techno tracks from my
hometown.

I started DJing while in college at college campuses around the state of
Michigan.  I put it on hold to start my engineering career and then a
family.  Later in life, I started to slowly gather equipment and
software to make music like I always wanted to.  I also started DJing
again, but this time with my other musical passion, Jazz, at an awesome
musical venue, Motor City Wine.
