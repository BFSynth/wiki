I've been making electronic music of one sort or another since I got my first four track in the early 90s messing with tape manipulation, fast tracker 2, and making my own weird instruments out of springs. In the 2000s I had a record release on Olde English Spelling Bee (of the now infamous Floral Shop/Macintosh Plus scandal) and did a small tour of the west coast with Garek Druss and Jeremy Long from the band Tecumseh. I now work at the library and make noises before I go to bed.
