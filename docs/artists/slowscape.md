Hi I’m Slowscape. I’m a visual artist, programmer, long time lover of electronic music, and I guess I can now say musician? I'll let you decide on that last bit. I’ve always had a desire to make music but struggled to find the right instrument for myself. That search ended when I discovered the wonderful world of modular synthesis. Performing on a modular is creative, unique, and they lend themselves to "happy mistakes"; modular synths ticked all the boxes for me. Be sure to drop by my YouTube or Instagram and say hi!

On the [[https://forum.aemodular.com | AE Modular forum]] I go under the username @slowscape.
