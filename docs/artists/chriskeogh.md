# Chris Keogh

[[img|artists/images/chriskeogh.jpg|400]]

I am a sound artist based in Liverpool, UK working mostly with found-sounds and samples that are rich in texture and sonic content. I generally flip-flop between electroacoustic compositions that are texturally complex and non-tonal; and more harmonically “conventional” electronic music that is a little easier on the ears.
