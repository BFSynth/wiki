[[img|artists/images/seanluke.jpg|400]]

In real life, Sean Luke is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University, where he does research into many topics in artificial intelligence, multiagent systems, and robotics.  But he also does research work in computational creativity and its application to music technology, and in his spare time he large builds synthesizer, sequencer, and patch editor tools.  In his spare time, Sean has built a lot of GRAINS firmware software, and has participated in the development and specification of MIDI running between modules in AE Modular systems. He lives in Washington, DC.
