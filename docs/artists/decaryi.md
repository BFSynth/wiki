# Decaryi

[[img|artists/images/decaryi.jpg|400]]

Decaryi is a musical project, created by Anton Schmidt, based in Augsburg. He started to make music as a teen by playing guitar in some metal bands but as his music taste expands, his style of creating
musig changed. Music from King Crimson, Can and Nicolas Jaar inspired him to make more progressive
music. Also improvisation started to be a big part of his music, as well as experimental ways of creating sound.

His music is a mix between electronic music, like trip hop, ambient and dub with rock music, like kraut -, psychedelic - or stoner rock. He works with several techniques to create his music. But most of the time he uses guitars, modular synths or field recorded samples.
